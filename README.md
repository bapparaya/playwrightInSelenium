# Playwright-Selenium Bridge: Leverage Playwright Features in Selenium Tests

While directly translating Playwright code to Selenium isn't always feasible due to inherent differences, here's a breakdown of the Playwright code snippets and their closest Selenium equivalents, along with explanations for when alternative approaches might be necessary:

first, we need to create page with below snippets
**page page=new page(driver);**

1. page.goTo(url);

Selenium Equivalent:


driver.get(url);
 

Explanation: This code navigates the browser to the specified URL. Both Playwright and Selenium offer this functionality.

2. page.locator("id=test");

Selenium Equivalent:


WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("test"));
 

Explanation: This code locates an element on the page using its ID attribute. However, in Selenium, you typically store the located element in a WebElement variable for further interaction.

3. page.locator("id=test").click();

Selenium Equivalent:


element.click();
 

Explanation: This code simulates a click on the previously located element.

4. page.locator("id=test").selectDropdown("test");

Selenium:

If the dropdown uses a <select> element:

Select select = new Select(element);
select.selectByValue("test"); 
 

If the dropdown uses a custom implementation:


You'll need to use Script or specific interaction methods provided by your chosen Selenium WebDriver implementation for interacting with custom dropdowns.

Explanation: This code interacts with a dropdown element. Due to the variety of dropdown implementations, Selenium might require using a Select class or custom interactions.

5. page.locator("id=test").fill("test");

Selenium:


element.sendKeys("test");
 

Explanation: This code enters text into a form field (input, textarea, etc.). Both Playwright and Selenium offer this functionality.

6. page.getByRole("button", "{ name: 'Sign in' }");

Selenium:

WebElement button = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[@role='button' and text()='Sign in']"));  // Or other locators
 

Explanation: This code locates a button element using ARIA role and text content. Selenium doesn't have a direct getByRole method, but you can achieve similar results using XPath or other locators.

7. page.getByLabel("text").click();

Selenium:

If the label element has a for attribute:

WebElement label = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("label[for='text']"));
label.click(); // Click on the label to indirectly click the associated element
 

If you need more precise targeting:

Use XPath or other locators to directly find the target element associated with the label.

Explanation: This code interacts with an element based on its associated label text. Selenium might require clicking the label to indirectly click the associated element or using more specific locators.

8. WebElement n = (WebElement) page.getByText("Welcome, John");

Selenium:


WebElement welcomeMessage = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//text()[contains(text(), 'Welcome, John')]")); 
 

Explanation: This code retrieves an element based on its text content. Selenium doesn't support direct text search on elements, so you'll use XPath or other locators.

9. page.expect(n).toBeVisible();

Selenium:


Assert.assertTrue(welcomeMessage.isDisplayed());
 

Explanation: This code verifies if the element is visible. Selenium uses assertions for verification.

10. List<WebElement> n1 = page.locators("id=test");

Selenium:


List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.id("test"));
 

Explanation: This code finds all elements matching a specific locator. Selenium's findElements method returns a list of matching elements.

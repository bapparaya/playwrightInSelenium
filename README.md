# Playwright-Selenium Bridge: Leverage Playwright Features in Selenium Tests

************** *************** **************** ***************** *************

While directly translating Playwright code to Selenium isn't always feasible due to inherent differences, here's a breakdown of the Playwright code snippets and their closest Selenium equivalents, along with explanations for when alternative approaches might be necessary:

first, we need to create page with below snippets
**page page=new page(driver);**

1. page.goTo(url);

Selenium Equivalent:


driver.get(url);
 

Explanation: This code navigates the browser to the specified URL. Both Playwright and Selenium offer this functionality.

2. page.locator("id=test");

Selenium Equivalent:


WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("test"));
 

Explanation: This code locates an element on the page using its ID attribute. However, in Selenium, you typically store the located element in a WebElement variable for further interaction.

3. page.locator("id=test").click();

Selenium Equivalent:


element.click();
 

Explanation: This code simulates a click on the previously located element.
